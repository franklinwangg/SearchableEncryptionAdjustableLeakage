# I don't understand what you are trying to say in your second paragraph. 
# How is an attack tailored for SEAL but not for Path ORAM? 
# SEAL uses a Path ORAM as a black box.

#  Our query recovery attack (see Figure 7) is very simple
#  and uses only volume pattern leakage. Having access to the
#  plaintext table T , the adversary computes the new padded
#  table for the queried attribute (Line 1 in Figure 7) using the
#  padding parameter x. Now, for a given encrypted query q with
#  size q the adversary uses T to find the candidate plaintext
#  values which have size q,andchooses one ofthem atrandom
#  (see Line 4 in Figure 7). Note that the higher the value of x
#  is, the larger the set of possible values in Line 4 is therefore
#  reducing the success rate of the attack.



# 0) encrypted query q with size q - goal : decrypt client's encrypted queries

# The database recovery (see Figure 8) works as follows.
#  First the adversary decrypts which keyword we are querying,
#  as beforeâ€”say this keyword is q. 
# Now, the goal is to map
#  the value q to the correct encrypted tuples in enc(T ), where
#  enc(T ) is the encrypted database produced by the SETUP
#  algorithm of SEAL. The adversary knowing from L2 leakage
#  the alpha bits of each returned encrypted tuple, chooses at random
#  for each of them one tuple from enc(T ) with same bits as
#  prefix andmapsq tothistuple. 
# Finally,the adversary removes
#  the chosen tuples t from enc(T ). The adversary is successful
#  if after this process the encrypted tuple t has value q at the
#  queried attribute. Clearly, the smaller is, the more bits the
#  adversary will have to guess (the larger the set of tuples with
#  same bits as prefix is) and therefore the less successful the
#  attack is going to be.
